/* 
  For a string to be able to be re-ordered into a palindrome
  It must have an even occurrence of every character
  Unless it is odd length, then it can have 1 character that
  can have an odd number of occurrences.
  Another way to look at it would be, if you cancel out ever char that has a pair,
  it can be a palindrome if you are left with 0 or 1 char remaining:
    - "dad" the "d" cancels with itself to leave "a"
    - "daad" the "d" and "a" cancel with itself to leave nothing
    - "daam" the "a" cancels with itself leaving "dm", more than 1 char remaining, can't be palindrome
